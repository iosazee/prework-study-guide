# Trilogy Web Development Precourse Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

- This webpage organizes the concepts I (or anyone intersted in enrolling in the bootcamp) needed to study
before the bootcamp proper began.
-   In building this project, I learnt the basic principles of how to use HTML to structure a webpage, use 
CSS to style it, use Git for version control and Github to collaborate with other developers, and how to use
JavaScript to add interactivity to a webpage.
-   This project solves a problem many a bootcamp student face, information overload! By organizing content needed
to learn in a systematic manner, information can be more easily accessed as at when needed.
