        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>In <strong>Semantic HTML elements</strong> the name of the element describes its content and role.</li>
          <li>Examples of common HTML elements include h1, p, ul, ol, li, img.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used in styling a webpage</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: <br>
            inline CSS, internal CSS stylesheet and external CSS stylesheet</li>
          <li>External stylesheets have to be linked to the html file by a link element within the head element </li>
          <li>A CSS rule consists of a selector (which can be an html element or defined class or id of an element), <br>
            a property and its assigned value enclosed in curly braces such as color: blue.</li>
          <li>An important concept to understand in applying CSS rules is to think of each html element as a box. <br>
            This is referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
           <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control software that lets us manage and keep track of ech version of our software.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tarcking changes locally in our computer, but to realise its full potential <br>
            it should be used in conjuction with Github or other git-based repository hosting services.</li>
          <li>Git commands are always prefaced with git and has to be employed at the CLI. <br>
            Egs include git -init, git clone, git status, git add, git commit -m, git log, etc</li>
          <li>The Github workflow starts from creating a new branch where work on a new feature <br>
            can be done safely without affecting the default branch or main.</li>
          <li>This is followed by making changes to your branch via commits and push to the remote repository.</li>
          <li>Once you have completed work on your feature branch, create a pull request. <br>
            This will allow your teammates review your code and to verify that it is safe to merge with the default branch.</li>
          <li>Once pull request is approved and your branch has been merged, it is good practice to delete your branch as <br>
            it indicates that the work on that branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.</li>
