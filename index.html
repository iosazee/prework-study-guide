          <li>Git is a version control software that lets us manage and keep track of ech version of our software.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tarcking changes locally in our computer, but to realise its full potential <br>
            it should be used in conjuction with Github or other git-based repository hosting services.</li>
          <li>Git commands are always prefaced with git and has to be employed at the CLI. <br>
            Egs include git -init, git clone, git status, git add, git commit -m, git log, etc</li>
          <li>The Github workflow starts from creating a new branch where work on a new feature <br>
            can be done safely without affecting the default branch or main.</li>
          <li>This is followed by making changes to your branch via commits and push to the remote repository.</li>
          <li>Once you have completed work on your feature branch, create a pull request. <br>
            This will allow your teammates review your code and to verify that it is safe to merge with the default branch.</li>
          <li>Once pull request is approved and your branch has been merged, it is good practice to delete your branch as <br>
            it indicates that the work on that branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.</li>
